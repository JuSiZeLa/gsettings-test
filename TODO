* wscript detection of glib-mkenums: waf issue 720

* then discuss wscript on glib mailing list

* Currently the wscript follows what the makefile does, maybe it would be better to validate the schemas
  without generating a .xml.valid file since there's not actually any point, waf can do better than this
